About
=====
This is version 1.0 of a Python binding for `sfeMovie <http://lucas.soltic.perso.luminy.univmed.fr/sfeMovie/>`_ 
released under the `LGPLv3 <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html>`_ license.

Python bindings really are the perfect way to sketch software using SFML.

.. note ::
        So far, this binding has only been tested thoroughly on Linux,
        though minimal testing has been done on Windows.

Getting the Code
================
After you've installed `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, you may issue
the following command to obtain the source::

    git clone git@github.com:Sonkun/python-sfemovie.git
    cd python-sfemovie
